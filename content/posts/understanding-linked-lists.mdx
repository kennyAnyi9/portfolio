### Introduction
Just like an array, a linked list is a data structure that represents data as a list of items. However, the way they store and access data is quite different. At first glance, visual representations of arrays and linked lists might seem similar, but under the hood, there are significant differences.

You may wonder why we’re focusing on arrays before diving into linked lists. The reason is simple: understanding arrays provides a solid visual foundation that makes it easier to grasp how linked lists operate. By comparing the two, you'll gain a better understanding of their structure and how they handle operations.

Let’s visualize these two data structures to get a clearer picture:

```bash
# Array
+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
+---+---+---+---+
```

```bash
# Linked list
+---+    +---+    +---+    +---+
| 1 | -> | 2 | -> | 3 | -> | 4 | -> NULL
+---+    +---+    +---+    +---+
```

You may notice that for both arrays and linked lists, we have elements stored in cells that are close to each other, with arrows showing the connection in the linked list. The reason for this representation is simplicity and to give you a visual understanding of how operations are performed in linked lists.

However, in memory, the representation above isn’t entirely correct—except for the array. We can visualize memory as a large block with smaller cells like so:

```bash
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

Now, let’s look at an array in memory:

```bash
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |     |     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

Next, let’s look at a linked list in memory:

```bash
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |  1  |     |  2  |     |     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |  3  |     |     |     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |     |  4  |     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

The representations above show us the differences in how arrays and linked lists are stored in memory. The array stores its elements in contiguous memory locations, while the linked list stores its elements in scattered memory locations, connected by pointers.

This significantly impacts how we access, delete, or insert data into these data structures. What makes the linked list unique is how these operations are performed.
