A linked list is a data structure that organizes data into a sequence of items, much like an array. However, the way linked lists store and access data is quite different. At first glance, arrays and linked lists may look similar in diagrams, but beneath the surface, they work in unique ways.

We'll start by comparing arrays to linked lists. This approach provides a crucial visual and conceptual framework. By contrasting arrays with linked lists, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the structure and operational characteristics of linked lists.


### Visualizing Arrays vs. Linked Lists

Here’s a simple representation of an array:
![array](https://res.cloudinary.com/daqo7qgci/image/upload/v1734489484/array_ysepdl.png)

And a linked list:

At first glance, both arrays and linked lists appear to store elements sequentially. In the linked list diagram, the arrows indicate how each item (node) connects to the next. This representation is simplified to help visualize how linked lists work. However, in memory, the representation above isn’t entirely correct—except for the array. We can visualize memory as a large block with smaller cells.

### Memory Representation

In memory, arrays store their elements in contiguous blocks as it is in the diagram below:

By contrast, linked lists store nodes in scattered locations, with each node pointing to the next:

The representations above show us the difference in how arrays and linked lists are stored in memory. Array elements are  stored  in contiguous memory locations, while linked list elements are stored in scattered memory locations, connected to each other by pointers.

This significantly impacts how we access, delete, or insert data into these data structures. What makes the linked list unique is how these operations are performed.

### Linked list as a data structure

Linked list may be scattered across different memory locations but connnected to each other. Each Item in a linked list is refered to as a node. So the question now is, how are these nodes connected if they really are scattered in memory? How do we know what nodes belong to the same list?
Luckily, each node comes with an extra piece of information that tells the computer where to find the next node. Meaning each node is made up of two cells, the first contains the actual data while the second contains a memory address showing the location of the next node in the list. This second cell is called the pointer which serves as a link to the memory address of the next node.

From the diagram above we can see that we have four items but with eight cells in memory, each having the list item itself and the pointer to the next node respectively. The first node represents the `head` and the last represents the `tail` whose extra piece of information points to `null`. So all the computer needs to start working is the memory address of the `head` node then it can follow the the link to subsequent nodes.

### Basic implementaion of a linked list in javascript

Here are a few things to consider:
- earlier we thoughgt of a linked list as a series of items scrattered in memory but linked together.
- meaning we can see each item as a separate entity called the node.
- the nodes are identical since they all have two parts, the item and a reference to the next node
- Then, we can form a blueprint and use it to create several instances of nodes
- when we are done with the several instances, we link them together to form a linked list.

Creating the bluprint with clases in javasript:
```js
class Node {
    constructor(item) {
        // 'item' is the data stored in the node
        this.item = item;

        // 'next_node' is initially null
        // This will later point to the next node in the list
        this.next_node = null;
    }
}
```

Creating instances of the node class

```js
//now we have a blueprint so we create several actual instances of the blueprint scatered in memory
const node1 = new Node("first");
const node2 = new Node("second");
const node3 = new Node("Third")

console.log(`
 node1: ${node1.item} (points to ${node1.next_node})
 node2: ${node2.item} (points to ${node2.next_node})
 node3: ${node3.item} (points to ${node3.next_node})
`)

/**
 result: node1: first (points to null)
         node2: second (points to null)
         node3: Third  (points to null)
 */

```

connecting the nodes:

```js
node1.next_node = node2
node2.next_node = node3

console.log(`
 node1: ${node1.item} (node1 points to ${node1.next_node.item})
 node2: ${node2.item} (node2 points to ${node2.next_node.item})
 node3: ${node3.item} (node3 points to ${node3.next_node})
`)

console.log(`${node1.item} -> ${node1.next_node.item} -> ${node3.item} -> ${node3.next_node}`)

/**
 result: node1: first (node1 points to second)
         node2: second (node2 points to Third)
         node3: Third (node3 points to null)

         first -> second -> Third -> null
 */
```

Congratulations we just implemented a simple liked list. In part two of this blog we will delve deeper into the linked list data structure.

Happy coding :)
