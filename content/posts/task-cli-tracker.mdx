## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll build a command-line task tracker application using Node.js. We'll go through each step of creating a practical CLI tool that helps manage tasks efficiently.

## Prerequisites
To be able to understand this tutorial, you need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js. You should have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

We would be building this project in 4 phases for better understanding:

- **Phase 1**: Project Setup.
- **Phase 2**: Adding tasks to the list.
- **Phase 3**: Marking tasks as done and deleting tasks.
- **Phase 4**: Saving the tasks to a file.

To keep things simple, we would explore the details of each phase in the following sections.

## Phase 1: Project Setup

### Project structure

```
task-cli/
├── data/               # Directory for our JSON storage
├── src/                # Directory for our source code
│   └── commands/       # Directory for command handlers
├── index.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

### Step 1: Create a new Node.js project and run `npm init` command.

```bash
# Create a directory for your project
mkdir task-cli
cd task-cli

# Initialize npm project
npm init -y
```

### Step 2: create your main file

```bash
# Create index.js file
touch index.js  # On Unix/Mac
# OR
type nul > index.js  # On Windows
```

### Step 3: Add the shebang line to the top of your `index.js` file

We have to make the file executable by adding the shebang line at the top of the `index.js` file.

```index.js
#!/usr/bin/env node
/*This line tells Unix-like systems
"Hey, use Node.js to run this file!" */
```

### Step 4: Update the `package.json` file

Add the following configuration to the `package.json` file:

```json
// ...other existing configurations
{
  "bin": {
    "task-cli": "./index.js" //This makes your command available globally when installed
  }
}
```
This tells npm:

- Create a command called "task-cli"
- When this command is run, execute the file at "./index.js"

Now we have to make our package available locally for testing by running the following command:

```bash
npm link
```
This creates a symbolic link to your package globally. After running this, you should be able to use the task-cli command from your terminal.

now to test if our CLI is working, run the following command:

- add the following code to your `index.js` file:

```js
console.log("CLI is working!");
```
- Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
task-cli
```

You should see "CLI is working!" in the console, which means our CLI is working as expected.

### Step 5: Capture command-line arguments

To capture command-line arguments will make is possible for the the CLI to understand commands like `task-cli add "Buy groceries"` or `task-cli list`.

We will use the `process.argv` array to capture the command-line arguments. The first two elements of the array are the path to Node.js and the path to the script being run. The rest of the elements are the command-line arguments.

{/* probably have to come back here latter and finish up cause i do not really get what is going on here */}

### Step 6: Create JSON file storage stucture

Create a `data` directory in the root of your project to store the tasks in a JSON file.

Now let us consider the following scenarios:

- When someone first installs and runs the CLI, no `task.json` file exists. We would need to create one which will have
the following structure:

```json
{
  "tasks": []  //empty array to store tasks
}
```
- In implementation we sould need to first check if the file exists, if it does not, we would create it and write the above content to it.
- If the file exists, we would read from it.

Now let us implement this:

- create a utils folder in the `src` directory and create a file called `storage.js` in it and add the following code:

```storage.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

/*
 * DEFINE PATHS
 We are telling Node.js where to store our data and tasks.json file

*/
const DATA_DIR = path.join(__dirname, '../../data')
const TASKS_FILE = path.join(DATA_DIR, 'tasks.json')


/*
 *INITIALIZE STORAGE SYSTEM
 *CREATE DATA DIRECTORY AND TASKS.JSON FILE IF THEY DO NOT EXIST
*/
const initailizeStrorage = () => {
    try{
        //check if dir exist, if not create it
        if(!fs.existsSync(DATA_DIR)){
            fs.mkdirSync(DATA_DIR)
        }

        // check if task.json exists else create it
        if(!fs.existsSync(TASKS_FILE)){
                const initialData ={
                    tasks: []
                };

              fs.writeFileSync(TASKS_FILE, JSON.stringify(initialData, null,2))
        }


    }catch(error){
        console.log('Error initializing storage:', error.message);
        process.exit(1)// exit if we can't initialize storage
    }

}

/**
* WRITE FUNCTION TO READ ALL TASKS FROM STORAGE
* @returns {Array} Aray of tasks
*/

const readTasks =()=>{
    try{
        const data =fs.readFileSync(TASKS_FILE, 'utf8');
        return JSON.parse(data).tasks;
    } catch(error){
        console.error('Error reading tasks:', error.message)
        return [];
    }
}

/**
 * SAVE TASKS TO STORAGE
 * @param {Array} tasks Array of tasks to save
 */

 const saveTasks = (tasks) => {
    try{
        const data ={
            tasks: tasks
        };
        fs.writeFileSync(TASKS_FILE, JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
    } catch(error){
        console.error('Error saving tasks, error.message')
    }
 }

 //functions to use in other files

 module.exports = {
    initailizeStrorage,
    readTasks,
    saveTasks
 };

```
- next let us create these files:

```
src/commands/
  ├── add.js
  ├── list.js
  ├── update.js
  └── delete.js
```

  - Now let us implement the basic command routing in the `index.js` file:



  ```js
  #!/usr/bin/env node

// Import our storage utility
const storage = require('./src/utils/storage');

// Initialize storage when CLI starts
storage.initializeStorage();

// Get command and arguments
const [,, command, ...args] = process.argv;

if (!command) {
    console.log('Please provide a command:');
    console.log('  add "task description"');
    console.log('  list');
    console.log('  update <id> "new description"');
    console.log('  delete <id>');
    process.exit(1);
    }
```
